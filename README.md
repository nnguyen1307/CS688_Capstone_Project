# Abstract
Motivated by the dynamics of Bandcamp's unique digital music distribution model, 
this study employs clustering techniques to categorize music genres/styles 
and group transactions in order to discover patterns in user behaviors.
Using dataset of one million sales from September 9, 2020, to October 2, 2020,
the result is four distinct
transaction clusters that highlight unique music
preferences and spending habits. Findings
demonstrate Bandcamp's potential in supporting artist
autonomy and user engagement. However, this study also identifies areas of improvement, 
including clustering refinement, further exploration for 'tagless' items, and improved text data analysis.
