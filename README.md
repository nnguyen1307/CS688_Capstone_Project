# Abstract
Motivated by the dynamics of Bandcamp's unique digital music distribution model, 
this study employs clustering techniques to categorize music genres/styles 
and group transactions in order to discover patterns in user behaviors.
Using dataset of one million sales from September 9, 2020, to October 2, 2020,
the result is four distinct
transaction clusters that highlight unique music
preferences and spending habits. Findings
demonstrate Bandcamp's potential in supporting artist
autonomy and user engagement. However, this study also identifies areas of improvement, 
including clustering refinement, further exploration for 'tagless' items, and improved text data analysis.

# Conclusion:

Leveraging the unique dynamics of Bandcamp's digital music distribution, I executed an intricate cluster analysis on a million sales to decipher patterns in music genre preferences and user behaviors. 
My findings? Four distinct user groups: eclectic listeners, vinyl collectors, dance music enthusiasts, and generous supporters. 
With these personas, I've identified tailored marketing strategies, like curated playlists for the DJ community and exclusive physical-digital bundles for merchandise enthusiasts. 
However, while revealing, there's still room for refinement - better separation of clusters and delving deeper into 'tagless' transactions could elevate the insight further. 
And as a suggestion, investing in more detailed text analysis could reveal even richer user profiles for targeted strategies.
